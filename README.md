Bunny-fortune 2.0 is a flashcard kinda app but when one clicks the bunny fortune card ,the card turns and show some fortune message.

For this app, I just used basics of react like components,displaying images,using dynamic classes (importing images &using in objects and css animation).

Responsiveness is achieved using css grid and achieved center position using flexbox
